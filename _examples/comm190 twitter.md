description: "This was prepared for COMM190 originally. The application takes the Personality Insights and Tone Analyzer services of Watson, and applies it to an individuals Twitter feed. By entering a twitter handle, the most recent 200 Tweets from that user are scraped, and this text is fed into Watson to develop a profile on the individual, and to determine the emotional content that is most commonly used in their tweets."
