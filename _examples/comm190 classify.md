img: "imgs/gifs/comm190_classify.gif"
description: "This was prepared for COMM190 originally. The general idea is to create a classifier which can identify the general review category for Amazon product reviews. The application uses the Natural Language Classification service to attempt to categorize the type of message as either (1) Overjoyed, (2) Satisfied, (3) Ambivalent, (4) Product Complaint, (5) Process Complaint, or (6) Gibberish. The example uses a data set pulled from a Keurig page on Amazon, though the same application could easily be applied to other data sets."
