description: "This demo application showcases Watson's NLP abilities by showcasing the static data that can be derived with the Natural Language Understanding service. Specifically, Amazon Reviews relating to toys produced by Battat were scraped, and then fed into Watson's NLU service. The service gave rise to a tremendous amount of annotated data, which was then aggregated by product, concept, or keyword. To push this application further, better aggregation techniques, data visualization, and search functionality would all be great add-ons."
