description: "This application was created with the intention of assessing written and verbal answers to questions during an MBA recruitment process. Specifically, the dashboard is set-up such that the user can go in, upload an audio file (for instance an entrance interview), and using the Watson Speech-to-Text have this transcribed. Then with the transcript of spoken word, Personality Insights, and Tone Analyzer can be applied to generate a numerical assessment of the individual. This data could then be fed back into a model useful for predicting success, or used otherwise in the entrance procedures."
