description: "This application showcases the power of Watson NLU and Discovery through the assessment of textual material relating to Rembrandt. Intended primarily as a tool for researcher use, the goal was to highlight the most important entities, concepts, and keywords from within the text, and to provide a mechanism through which rich natural language queries could be entered. Ultimately, the demo could be easily interchanged with separate data sources, providing a knowledge repository of sorts for any domain."
