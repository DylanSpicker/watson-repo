description: "This demo was adapted from the Starter Kit provided by IBM entitled 'Social Customer Care'. The general idea is to provide a dashboard to a customer service agent who can then use the power of Watson to easily manage and triage tweets that are being sent to the support account. The application uses the Classification (see COMM190 - Natural Language Classifier) service to attempt to categorize the type of message, and then uses Tone Analyzer and Personality Insights to give a breakdown of the emotional content of the Tweet, and the individuals tendencies, respectively."
