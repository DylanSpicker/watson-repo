description: "WatsNew provides a GUI ontop of Watson News Discovery, which allows the user to not only search for current news articles in a Natural Language manner, but also to visual the relationships between stories with a network graph. The stories are annotated with sentiment, concepts, keywords, and machine-generated summaries, attempting to give the highest overview of a topic (and how topics are linked) in an easy-to-digest format."
